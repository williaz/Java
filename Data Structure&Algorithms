There is a standard notation for this idea, called "0-notation." Its basic parameter
is n, the size of a problem instance, and the complexity or running time is
expressed as a function of n. The "0" is for order, as in "Binary search is O(1ogn);
it takes on the order of logn steps to search an array of n items."

Notation Name
O(1) constant
O(1ogn) logarithmic
O(n) linear
O(n1ogn) nlogn
0(n2) quadratic
oh3) cubic
O(2") exponential

Example
array index
binary search
string comparison
quicksort
simple sorting methods
matrix multiplication
set partitioning

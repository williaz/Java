Browsers display the contents of
headings at different sizes. The
contents of an <h1> element is
the largest, and the contents of
an <h6> element is the smallest.
The exact size at which each
browser shows the headings
can vary slightly. Users can also
adjust the size of text in their
browser. You will see how to
control the size of text, its color,
and the fonts used when we
come to look at CSS

By default, a browser will show
each paragraph on a new line
with some space between it and
any subsequent paragraphs.

An empty element usually
has only one tag. Before the
closing angled bracket of an
empty element there will often
be a space and a forward slash
character. Some web page
authors miss this out but it is a
good habit to get into.

Browsers tend to indent the
contents of the <blockquote>
element, however you should not
use this element just to indent a
piece of text — rather you should
achieve this effect using CSS.

In HTML 4 there was a separate
<acronym> element for
acronyms. To spell out the full
form of the acronym, the title
attribute was used (as with the
<abbr> element above). HTML5
just uses the <abbr> element
for both abbreviations and
acronyms.

In HTML5, <cite> should not
really be used for a person's
name — but it was allowed in
HTML 4, so most people are
likely to continue to use it.

Some browsers show the
content of the <dfn> element in
italics. Safari and Chrome do not
change its appearance.

Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the <ol>
element to specify the type of
numbering (numbers, letters,
roman numerals and so on). It
is better to use the CSS liststyle-
type property

Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the <ul>
element to specify the type of
bullet point (circles, squares,
diamonds and so on). It is better
to use the CSS list-styletype
property

On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a
website are sometimes referred to as directories.

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.

On a big site you might like to
add subfolders inside the images
folder. For example, images such
as logos and buttons might sit in
a folder called interface, product
photographs might sit in a page
called products, and images
related to news might live in a
folder called news.

The text used in the alt attribute
is often referred to as alt text.
It should give an accurate
description of the image content
so it can be understood by
screen reader software (used by
people with visual impairments)
and search engines.

If the image is just to make a
page look more attractive (and
it has no meaning, such as a
graphic dividing line), then the
alt attribute should still be used
but the quotes should be left
empty.

Use GIF or PNG format
when saving images
with few colors or large
areas of the same color.

Vector images differ from bitmap images and
are resolution-independent. Vector images are
commonly created in programs such as Adobe
Illustrator.

Some browsers automatically
draw lines around the table
and/or the individual cells.

1. If users need to see all options
at a glance, radio buttons are
better suited.
2. If there is a very long list
of options (such as a list of
countries), drop down list boxes
work better.

Unfortunately, the way that
browsers have implemented this
attribute is not perfect, and it
should be tested throroughly if
used (in particular in Firefox and
Safari on a Mac).(multi sel box-size)

It is a good idea to tell users if
they can select more than one
option at a time. It is also helpful
to indicate that on a PC they
should hold down the control key
while selecting multiple options
and on a Mac they should use
the command key while selecting
options.

As a rule of thumb, here are the
best places to place labels on
form controls.
Above or to the left:
● Text inputs
● Text areas
● Select boxes
● File uploads
To the right:
● Individual checkboxes
● Individual radio buttons

At the time of writing, only
Chrome and Opera supported
HTML5 validation, although other
browsers are expected to follow.
In order to support older browsers
(that do not understand HTML5),
web page authors are likely to
continue using JavaScript to
validate forms.

HTML5 introduces new form
controls to standardize the
way that some information is
gathered. Older browsers that
do not recognize these inputs
will just treat them as a single
line text box.

Recent browsers add some
features that improve usability.
For example, Safari on a Mac
adds a cross to clear the search
box when you have started to
enter information. Safari also
automatically rounds the corners
on the search input field.

To reach as many browsers as
possible, you should provide the
video in the following formats:
H264: IE and Safari
WebM: Android, Chrome,
Firefox, Opera

(Due to a bug on the iPad, you
should provide the MP4 video
as the first format. Otherwise, it
might not play.)

If you start to work with HTML5
video in depth, you can also:
● Create your own playback
controls
● Provide different versions
of the video for browsers
that have different sized
screens (so you can provide
lower resolution content for
handheld devices)
● Tell different parts of a page
to change when the video
reaches a certain point

support the Ogg
Vorbis audio format (Firefox,
Chrome, and Opera). For it to
work in Safari 5 and IE 9, the
audio would need to be in MP3
format

Browsers display the contents of
headings at different sizes. The
contents of an <h1> element is
the largest, and the contents of
an <h6> element is the smallest.
The exact size at which each
browser shows the headings
can vary slightly. Users can also
adjust the size of text in their
browser. You will see how to
control the size of text, its color,
and the fonts used when we
come to look at CSS

By default, a browser will show
each paragraph on a new line
with some space between it and
any subsequent paragraphs.

An empty element usually
has only one tag. Before the
closing angled bracket of an
empty element there will often
be a space and a forward slash
character. Some web page
authors miss this out but it is a
good habit to get into.

Browsers tend to indent the
contents of the <blockquote>
element, however you should not
use this element just to indent a
piece of text — rather you should
achieve this effect using CSS.

In HTML 4 there was a separate
<acronym> element for
acronyms. To spell out the full
form of the acronym, the title
attribute was used (as with the
<abbr> element above). HTML5
just uses the <abbr> element
for both abbreviations and
acronyms.

In HTML5, <cite> should not
really be used for a person's
name — but it was allowed in
HTML 4, so most people are
likely to continue to use it.

Some browsers show the
content of the <dfn> element in
italics. Safari and Chrome do not
change its appearance.

Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the <ol>
element to specify the type of
numbering (numbers, letters,
roman numerals and so on). It
is better to use the CSS liststyle-
type property

Sometimes you may see a type
attribute used with the <ul>
element to specify the type of
bullet point (circles, squares,
diamonds and so on). It is better
to use the CSS list-styletype
property
